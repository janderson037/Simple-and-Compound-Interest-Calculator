# Simple-and-Compound-Interest-Calculator
Within this project, I created a Python program that calculated the simple or compound interest on a principle amount for a user. 
The program took in various user input such as a principle amount, whether the amount would have a simple or compound rate, an interest rate, and a time frame within in years. 
Using all of this information, the program would output the financial gain on the principle amount each year it was collecting interest as well as the complete amount the user would have at the end of their time frame.
